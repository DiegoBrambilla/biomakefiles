# biomakefiles

Library makefiles for various bioinformatic tools.

The library of makefiles in `lib/make` are meant for those who want to run common
bioinformatic tools a little bit easier with better documentation of which programs
were run, using which files etc., without commiting to a "pipeline".

The idea behind this is to set up a "lab" for computational analyses:
