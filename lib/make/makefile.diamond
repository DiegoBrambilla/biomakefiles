# Library makefile to make running the LAST aligner simpler.
#
# Include the full path of this file in your Makefile and making databases and
# running the aligner (lastal) can be done via make. See documentation in in
# the biomakefile Git repository: doc/makefile.md and documentation for

# *** Parameters ***

# Override in your Makefile by setting a parameter *after* the row that
# includes this file, see documentation in doc/makefile.md.
#
# DIAMOND_DB_PATH sets the directory where to look for the database files. The

#
# To set options, override this by inserting a row similar to the one below but
# with whatever options you'd like to add in your Makefile *after* you include
# this file.

# *** Targets ***

# Running the Diamond aligner

# Nucleotides in fastq.gz file against the NCBI RefSeq protein database
%.refseq_protein.daa: %.fastq.gz
	diamond blastx -d $(DIAMOND_DB_PATH)/refseq_protein --query $< -o $(basename $@) $(DIAMOND_ALIGN_OPTS)

# Creating the database

# From protein sequences in a file ending with .faa
# (Currently, Diamond only works with protein sequence databases.)
%.dmnd: %.faa
	diamond makedb --in $< -d $(basename $@)
