# Setting up a new project directory

## Copy .gitignore

In lib/gitignores there's a file that tries to make sure you're not adding too large files
to the git repository: project_root.gitignore. Copy that to the root directory of
the new project; make sure it's called `.gitignore`.

```

$ cp *path_to_biomakefiles*/lib/gitignores/project_root.gitignore .gitignore

```
